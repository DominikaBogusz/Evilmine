This game was made as a graduation project of my Engineering Thesis. Main goal was to create gameplay showing dynamic difficulty balancing process.

## Review

It's a 2D, side-view, quasi-RPG game with survival mode areas placed around the map. Player have to penetrate the mine, fighting with various monsters and collecting treasures. The gameplay is varied by randomly generated enemies (of adequate level) and bonuses (with opportune frequency).
